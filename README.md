# Predictive-Analysis-of-Loan-Status-Using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on predicting the loan status (approval or default) using supervised learning algorithms. By leveraging machine learning techniques such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest, the model aims to accurately classify loan applications based on applicant details and financial history.

## Key Features
* Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.<br/>
* Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing data distributions and relationships between variables.<br/>
* Model Building: Implementing Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers.<br/>
* Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.<br/>
* Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters for better performance.<br/>

## Algorithms Used
Logistic Regression<br/>
Random Forest Classifier<br/>
Decision Tree <br/>
KNN <br/>

# Dataset
The dataset contains information about loan applicants, including age, income, credit score, loan amount, and other relevant features. The target variable is the loan status, which indicates whether a loan was approved or defaulted.<br/>

# Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 87.6% with a balanced performance between precision and recall. The Random Forest classifier provided better generalization and robustness compared to Logistic Regression.<br/>

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of supervised learning algorithms in predicting loan status, aiding financial institutions in risk assessment and decision-making.
